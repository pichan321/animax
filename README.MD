### Description
 Animax is a Go(Golang) public module created in hope of making video/audio editing on Golang become a much easier task. 
Animax also offers extra functions that module users might or might not find useful depending on their use cases:
- NewAspectRatio
- AddOverlayBackground
- AddOverlayBackgroundWithLogo
- UploadToFacebookReels
- UploadToFacebookVideo

The module is inspired by MovieGo, and Cinema. Huge props to the creators of the two modules.
  
### Installations

Animax heavily relies on FFMPEG. To run Animax you would first have to install FFMPEG and add it to your environment path. Instructions on how to install FFMPEG can be found on this link: [How to Install FFmpeg ](https://gist.github.com/barbietunnie/47a3de3de3274956617ce092a3bc03a1)
