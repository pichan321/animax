### Description
 Animax is a Go (Golang) public module created in hope of making video/audio editing on Golang become a much easier task for everyone. 
Animax also offers extra functions that module users might or might not find useful depending on their use cases:
- NewAspectRatio
- AddOverlayBackground
- AddOverlayBackgroundWithLogo
- PeriodicSkip
- UploadToFacebookReels
- UploadToFacebookVideo

The module is inspired by MovieGo, and Cinema. Huge props to the creators of the two modules.
  
### Installations
